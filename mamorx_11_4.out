### Background 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 199, 350, 260]]<|/det|>
The growing amounts of scientific literatures increase the burden of reviewers. Recent studies have explored AI-generated scientific paper reviews. While models like GPT-4 show promise, researchers hold mixed views on this approach. 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 275, 199, 292]]<|/det|>
#### Major challenges to AI reviews: 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 293, 280, 309]]<|/det|>
- Factual inaccuracies and outdated information 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 310, 199, 325]]<|/det|>
- Reference fabrication 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 326, 199, 342]]<|/det|>
- Weak context understanding 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 343, 199, 359]]<|/det|>
- Inability to provide personalized, constructive feedback 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 360, 333, 375]]<|/det|>
Paper review processes as done by human reviewers often integrate 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 376, 163, 392]]<|/det|>
- textual analysis, 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 393, 183, 408]]<|/det|>
- visual interpretation 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 409, 183, 425]]<|/det|>
- citation assessment 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 426, 163, 441]]<|/det|>
- external knowledge 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 460, 350, 504]]<|/det|>
Recent advances in multimodal AI models (processing text, images, and graphs) and multi-agent systems with external knowledge access offer promising new approaches to address these limitations. 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[130, 511, 200, 528]]<|/det|>
### Methods 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 535, 333, 588]]<|/det|>

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 589, 333, 633]]<|/det|>
- All agents have access to the full text of the paper
- Each agent has different system prompt-driven task 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 634, 333, 678]]<|/det|>

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 679, 310, 694]]<|/det|>
- Clarity Agent: Assesses organization, structure, and presentation 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 710, 150, 725]]<|/det|>
### Novel components 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 727, 350, 755]]<|/det|>
- Novelty Assessment: Queries Semantic Scholar to evaluate paper originality 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 756, 333, 800]]<|/det|>
- Generates queries, builds database of related papers
- Removes papers already cited by subject paper
- Performs pairwise novelty assessment against relevant papers

### Background 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 199, 350, 260]]<|/det|>
The growing amounts of scientific literatures increase the burden of reviewers. Recent studies have explored AI-generated scientific paper reviews. While models like GPT-4 show promise, researchers hold mixed views on this approach. 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 275, 199, 292]]<|/det|>
#### Major challenges to AI reviews: 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 293, 280, 309]]<|/det|>
- Factual inaccuracies and outdated information 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 310, 199, 325]]<|/det|>
- Reference fabrication 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 326, 199, 342]]<|/det|>
- Weak context understanding 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 343, 199, 359]]<|/det|>
- Inability to provide personalized, constructive feedback 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 360, 333, 375]]<|/det|>
Paper review processes as done by human reviewers often integrate 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 376, 163, 392]]<|/det|>
- textual analysis, 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 393, 183, 408]]<|/det|>
- visual interpretation 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 409, 183, 425]]<|/det|>
- citation assessment 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 426, 163, 441]]<|/det|>
- external knowledge 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[50, 460, 350, 504]]<|/det|>
Recent advances in multimodal AI models (processing text, images, and graphs) and multi-agent systems with external knowledge access offer promising new approaches to address these limitations.
