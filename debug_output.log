You are using a model of type deepseek_vl_v2 to instantiate a model of type DeepseekOCR. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.
Some weights of DeepseekOCRForCausalLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR and are newly initialized: ['model.vision_model.embeddings.position_ids']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
