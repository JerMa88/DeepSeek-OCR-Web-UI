You are using a model of type deepseek_vl_v2 to instantiate a model of type DeepseekOCR. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.

Some weights of DeepseekOCRForCausalLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR and are newly initialized: ['model.vision_model.embeddings.position_ids']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

However, `temperature` is set to `0.0` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `temperature`.

The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
The `seen_tokens` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v4.41. Use the `cache_position` model input instead.
`get_max_cache()` is deprecated for all Cache classes. Use `get_max_cache_shape()` instead. Calling `get_max_cache()` will raise error from v4.48
The attention layers in this model are transitioning from computing the RoPE embeddings internally through `position_ids` (2D tensor with the indexes of the tokens), to using externally computed `position_embeddings` (Tuple of tensors, containing cos and sin). In v4.46 `position_ids` will be removed and `position_embeddings` will be mandatory.
This is a friendly reminder - the current text generation call will exceed the model's predefined maximum length (8192). Depending on the model, you may observe exceptions, performance degradation, or nothing at all.
